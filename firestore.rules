/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Study Platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data ownership and restricts access to sensitive
 * information. Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data
 * unless explicitly allowed otherwise. Public read access is granted to certain
 * collections, while writes are strictly controlled via ownership checks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User-specific data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring privacy.
 * - Public content (e.g., courses, posts) resides in top-level collections.
 * - Partner-related data is stored under /partners/{partnerId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles and enrollments.
 * - Super admin roles are not explicitly defined, defaulting to owner-only access.
 * - Public read access is enabled for courses, posts, and study rooms.
 * - Partner-related data access is not defined, defaulting to closed access.
 * - Partner application submissions are public, partner data is closed, and no relationships between partners and users are defined.
 * - Denormalization: No specific denormalization for authorization is required in this round, as authorization is based only on the current document and path.
